He couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor\\nQuirrell.\\n      “Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta\\npresents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands,\\nOllivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.”\\n      A magic wand…this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.\\n      The last shop was narrow and shabby.

He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The\\nowl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t wake\\nup. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’s coat.\\n      “Don’t do that.”\\n      Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak\\nfiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.\\n      “Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl —”\\n      “Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\\n      “What?”\\n      “He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets.”\\n      Hagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets — bunches of\\nkeys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...finally, Harry\\npulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.\\n      “Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily.\\n      “Knuts?”\\n      “The little bronze ones.” a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the\\nshape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a\\ncloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked\\ndistinctly ruffled.\\n      “How did you know it was me?” she asked.\\n      “My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”\\n      “You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said\\nProfessor McGonagall.\\n      “All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a\\ndozen feasts and parties on my way here.”\\n      Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\\n      “Oh yes, I’ve celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently. “You’d think\\nthey’d be a bit more careful, but no —even the Muggles have noticed\\nsomething’s going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head back at the\\nDursleys’ dark living-room window. “I heard it. Flocks of owls…shooting\\nstars…Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice “No — Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons.\\nWe could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him\\nback in the wild!”\\n      “Brilliant!” said Ron. “How about it, Hagrid?”\\n      And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to\\nask him.\\n \\nThe following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and\\nHarry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to\\nbed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst\\nopen. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s invisibility cloak.\\nHe had been down at Hagrid’s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now\\neating dead rats by the crate.\\n      “It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a\\nbloody handkerchief. “I’m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell\\nyou, that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but the way Hagrid pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking\\nowl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment.

Hope you’re well.\\nHagrid\\n \\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak,\\nwent to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and\\nsat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.\\n      Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.\\n      “Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still\\nashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\\n      “He’s not going,” he said.\\n      Hagrid grunted.\\n      “I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he said.\\n      “A what?” said Harry, interested.what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldn’t see how he\\nand Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — he\\nyawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect them.…\\n      How very wrong he was.\\n      Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on\\nthe wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a\\nstatue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so\\nmuch as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls\\nswooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\\n      A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so\\nsuddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground.\\nThe cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\\n      Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive.

Although Hagrid seemed to know\\nwhere he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary\\nway. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained\\nloudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\\n      “I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they\\nclimbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.\\n      Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do\\nwas keep close behind him.

Indeed, by the\\nnext morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had\\nbeen an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In\\nthe meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been\\nmoved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what\\ncould possibly need such heavy protection.\\n      “It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.\\n      “Or both,” said Harry.\\n      But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was\\nabout two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was\\nwithout further clues.\\n      Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay\\nunderneath the dog and the trapdoor.

She patrolled the corridors alone.\\nBreak a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she’d whisk off for\\nFilch, who’d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret\\npassageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley\\ntwins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated\\nhim, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\\n      And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes\\nthemselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than\\nwaving your wand and saying a few funny words.\\n      They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every\\nWednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements “P-P-Petunia!” he gasped.\\n      Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high\\nout of his reach.

Oh my goodness — Vernon!”\\n      They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and\\nDudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn’t used to being ignored.

After all,\\nthey normally pretended she didn’t have a sister.\\n      “No,” she said sharply. “Why?”In Chapter Ten of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, titled \"Halloween,\" Harry and Ron are still at Hogwarts the day after their encounter with the three-headed dog.

Malfoy tries to taunt Harry about the broomstick, but Professor Flitwick intervenes and congratulates Harry on his new broomstick.\\nHarry has his first Quidditch training session with Oliver Wood, the Quidditch captain. Wood explains the rules of Quidditch to Harry and shows him the different balls used in the game. Harry impresses Wood with his flying skills and catches all the practice balls thrown at him.\\nAs the weeks go by, Harry becomes more settled at Hogwarts and feels like the castle is more like home than Privet Drive. On Halloween morning, Professor Flitwick teaches the students how to make objects fly in Charms class. Harry partners with Seamus Finnigan, while Ron partners with Hermione, who is still not speaking to them. Hermione excels in the lesson, causing Ron to become even more frustrated with her.\\nDuring the Halloween feast, Professor Quirrell interrupts the festivities to announce that there is a troll in the dungeons. Percy leads the students back to their dormitories, but Harry and Ron realize that Hermione doesn\\'t know about the troll. They rush to warn her and find her in the girls\\' bathroom, cornered by the troll. Harry and Ron manage to save Hermione by distracting the troll and knocking it out.\\nProfessor McGonagall praises Harry and Ron for their bravery, and Hermione takes the blame for being in the bathroom alone. She lies to protect Harry and Ron, earning Gryffindor house points and solidifying their friendship. From that moment on, Hermione becomes a part of their trio, and they bond over their shared experience of facing a mountain troll together.

Harry manages to catch the Golden Snitch, winning the match for Gryffindor. After the match, Harry, Ron, and Hermione confront Hagrid about Snape\\'s suspicious behavior and his possible involvement in trying to steal something guarded by a three-headed dog named Fluffy.\\nHagrid is defensive and dismisses their concerns, insisting that Snape would never harm a student. He also reveals that the object Fluffy is guarding is connected to someone named Nicolas Flamel. Despite Hagrid\\'s warnings, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are determined to uncover the truth behind Snape\\'s actions and the mystery surrounding Fluffy and Nicolas Flamel. The chapter ends with the trio determined to investigate further, despite the dangers involved.

During the flying lesson, Neville injures himself and Harry impresses everyone with his flying skills, catching Neville\\'s Remembrall in a daring move.\\nLater, Malfoy challenges Harry to a wizard\\'s duel at midnight in the trophy room. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sneak out to meet Malfoy, but they are almost caught by Filch. They end up in a forbidden corridor on the third floor, where they encounter a three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor. Hermione realizes that the dog is guarding something important, possibly the package from vault seven hundred and thirteen.\\nAfter narrowly escaping the dog, the trio returns to Gryffindor tower, where Hermione scolds them for their reckless behavior. Despite the danger they faced, Harry is left wondering about the mysterious package and what secrets it may hold. The chapter ends with a sense of foreboding and the promise of more adventures to come. (Chapter 9)']\n"
