They rush to warn her and find her in the girls\\\\\\\\\\' bathroom, cornered by the troll. Harry and Ron distract the troll and save Hermione, with Ron accidentally knocking out the troll with its own club.\\\\nProfessor McGonagall praises Harry and Ron for their bravery, and Hermione takes the blame for being in the bathroom alone.
